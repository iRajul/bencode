# Bencode
Bencode is c++ library used to encode and decode [bencode](https://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification) data. I made this library for study purpose. You can extend it in antway they want.

I took help from [here](https://github.com/s3rvac/cpp-bencoding).

` g++ main.cxx ../src/decode.cxx ../src/items.cxx ../src/visitor.cxx -std=c++14 -I../include`
